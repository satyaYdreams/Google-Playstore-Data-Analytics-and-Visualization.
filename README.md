# Google-Playstore-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization.
𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 for an organization based in San Fransisco. The project is based on getting insights from 𝐀𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐢𝐝 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐬 having fields like App names, ratings, reviews, category, and many other fields. 
🔷 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐞 - Playstore Apps Analysis & Visualization

The Project will consist of 2 modules:
◾ 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 1: Pre-processing, Analyzing data using 𝑷𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒏, 𝑬𝒙𝒄𝒆𝒍, and 𝑴𝒚𝑺𝑸𝑳.
◾ 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 2: Visualizing data using 𝑷𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒓 𝑩𝑰/ 𝑻𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒖.

𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭:
🔸 Python
🔸 MySQL
🔸 Excel
🔸 PowerBI/ Tableau

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 1:

𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐞 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐞𝐝:
Task 1. Pre-processing the data
𝐒𝐮𝐛-𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐤 1: Removing duplicate rows
𝐒𝐮𝐛-𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐤 2: Remove irrelevant values from each column if any
𝐒𝐮𝐛-𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐤 3: Export the cleaned dataset as a .csv file and prepare the data using excel.
𝐒𝐮𝐛𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐤 4: Encoding data into a suitable format.

I have completed the Module 1 tasks which include 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠, and 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚-𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 using 𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐬 and 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐥, and got insights from the datasets 
using 𝐒𝐐𝐋 queries in 𝐌𝐲𝐒𝐐𝐋 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐛𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐡.

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 2:In the 2nd module, we have used both datasets for visualizing what the numbers in and behind the data want to convey. We have created a dashboard
for the same using different statistical graphs and diagrams for a visual understanding and analysis.

With this live project opportunity, I have gained the experience of working with real-world database. 
We have worked as a team, beyond the different time zones problem, we have shown our teamwork, 
cross functional and communication skills perfectly here. Truly I have a great experience working with this project
